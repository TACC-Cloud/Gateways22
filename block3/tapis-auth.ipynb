    "Authentication\n",
    "===============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Tapis has robust Authentication/Authorization pathways - we could easliy spend an hour or more discussing them, but will keep our focus simple for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tapis API uses OAuth 2 for managing authentication and authorization. Luckily for this tutorial our JupyterHub already has a Tapis CLI client installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a new terminal notebook so that we can start to use the Tapis CLI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following\n",
    "```\n",
    "auth-check\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to set our Tapis Tenant that we will be using. Run the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "tenants-init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the the XXXXXXXXXXXX tenant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can began authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a client and getting a set of API Keys\n",
    "===============================================\n",
    "The Tapis API uses OAuth 2 for managing authentication and authorization. Before you work with Tapis, you must create an OAuth client application and record the API keys that are returned. This is a one-time action per machine that you use the CLI, so if you already have a set of API keys, skip to the next tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a set of API keys using the Tapis clients service as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clients-create -S -v -N my_api_client -D \"Client used for app development\" ```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* The -N flag allows you to specify a machine-readable name for your application and -D provides the description. The -S option stores your API keys for future use, so you will not need to manually enter them when you authenticate later. Please do not forget to include the -S option when creating a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be prompted for yournusername and password. Enter them when asked, then wait for a response that resembles this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"_links\": {\n",
    "        \"self\": {\n",
    "            \"href\": \"https://uhhpctenant.its.hawaii.edu/clients/v2/my_client\"\n",
    "        },\n",

    "            \"href\": \"https://uhhpctenant.its.hawaii.edu/clients/v2/my_client/subscriptions/\"\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need access to the ```consumerKey``` and ```consumerSecret``` values when setting up on other hosts. So, please take a moment and record *client_name*, *consumerKey*, and *consumerSecret* somewhere safe. If you lose these values, you can create a new instance of the client by deleting the old client (clients-delete CLIENT_NAME) and creating it again (or create a new client with a different name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining an OAuth 2 authentication token\n",
    "=========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens are a form of short-lived, temporary authenticiation and authorization used in place of your username and password. To interact with Tapis, you will need to acquire one. Each Tapis token, typically, expires after 4 hours, but can easily be refreshed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a host where you have configured a Tapis OAuth2 client already, the CLI command to get a new token is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```auth-tokens-create -S -v```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then be prompted to enter your *API password*. **Type your user password**.  At this point, you should receive an affirmation of success in your terminal that resembles this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Token successfully refreshed and cached for 14400 seconds\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"access_token\": \"abc1236eb2c917a4c5796eb1cc2c6f\",\n",
    "    \"expires_in\": 14400,\n",
    "    \"refresh_token\": \"abc12315b26ebc1aec5d6e232bb455b\",\n",
    "    \"token_type\": \"bearer\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed the CLI on a new host and are creating a token for the first time on that host, you will need to also include the key and secret from your Oauth2 client. In the future, the key and secret will be cached on the host(~/.agave/current is the file this information is cached within) and you will not need to pass them in the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```auth-tokens-create -S -v --apisecret CONSUMER_SECRET --apikey CONSUMER_KEY```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refreshing your token\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial won't take very long, but if you are interrupted and come back later, you might find your token has expired. You can always refresh a token as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```auth-tokens-refresh -S -v```\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful refresh should appear:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Token for uhhpctenant.its.hawaii.edu:seanbc successfully refreshed and cached for 3600 seconds\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"access_token\": \"abc1235418ffce0da7fbdcb193d0ef\",\n",
    "    \"expires_in\": 3600,\n",
    "    \"refresh_token\": \"abc123524638e9d7ed0c3adcd3e99d5\",\n",
    "    \"scope\": \"default\",\n",
    "    \"token_type\": \"bearer\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
