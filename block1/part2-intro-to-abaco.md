# Intro to Abaco

### What is Abaco?

Abaco is an NSF-funded web service and distributed computing platform providing functions-as-a-service (FaaS) 
to the research computing community. Abaco implements functions using the Actor Model of concurrent computation. 
In Abaco, each actor is associated with a Docker image, and actor containers are executed in response to messages 
posted to their inbox which itself is given by a URI exposed over HTTP.

Full documentation is available on ReadTheDocs: https://abaco.readthedocs.io

### Using Abaco

The primary Abaco instance is hosted at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. It requires a TACC account and access
to the TACC Cloud APIs. Full details on getting the required accounts can be found on the Getting Started Guide here
https://abaco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/index.html#account-creation-and-software-installation

For this workshop, we have installed TACC training accounts on your VM. If you wish to use your own TACC account
you will also need TACC Cloud API keys (see the Working With TACC OAuth section, 
https://abaco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/index.html#working-with-tacc-oauth)
