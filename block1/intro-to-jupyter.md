Introduction to the Jupyter Notebook Environment and generating a Tapis v3 Token
===


Jupyter is an open source project that provides a webapp interface for writing code and documents. Throughout this tutorial, we will be using a Jupyter Notebook environment for development. 

### Starting up your Jupyter Notebook Environment

Your jupyter notebook server should be already running at `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=` (The one you got in the previous section after running the docker image). You can reach it by going to that location in a browser window.

Once you open a browser with your Jupyter environment, you should see something similar to this:

### Creating a Notebook

To create a new notebook for writing code, start by clicking 'New' in the upper right corner. From here, you will be able to choose what type of notebook you want. For this tutorial, we will be using Python 3.

Once you open a notebook, you can write and run python code. To execute a line of code, press `shift + Enter`.
