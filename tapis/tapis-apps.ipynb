Historically, this has actually been the hardest part for new users to figure out. So, to ease the process, we've created a couple of tools that you can use to define your apps. The first is the <a href=\"https://uhhpcgw.its.hawaii.edu/app/#/apps/new\" title=\"App Builder Wizard\">App Builder Wizard</a> page. On this page you will find a form-driven wizard that you can fill out generate the JSON description for your app. Once created, you can POST the JSON directly to the Apps service. If you are new to app registration, this is a great place to start because it shrinks the learning curve involved in defining your app.\n"

    "* **deploymentSystem** - The data storage system where you keep the app assets, such as the wrapper script, test script, etc.  App assets are not stored on the execution system where they run.  For provenance and reproducibility, Agave requires that you keep them on a storage system.\n",
    "* **deploymentPath** - the directory on the deploymentSystem where the app bundle is located\n",
    "* **templatePath** - This template is what Agave uses to run your app.  The path you specify here is relative to the deploymentPath\n",
    "* **testPath** - The intention here is that you include a testcase inside of your app bundle.\n",
    "* **argument** - In combination with \"showArgument\", the \"argument\" keyword is a convenience that lets you build up commandline arguments in your wrapper script.\n",
