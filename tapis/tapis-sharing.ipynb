    "# Share an Application with Others\n",
    "As a normal user of the UH tenant, you have permissions to build and deploy\n",
    "private apps only. Private apps are, by default, only visible to you. To share\n",
    "an app with your colleagues, follow the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update permissions on an app\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have the private app `username-tensorflow-0.1` , you can check who has\n",
    "permission to access the app with the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% apps-pems-list username-tensorflow-0.1\n",
    "username READ WRITE EXECUTE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Replace `username` with your UH username). By default, as creator of the app\n",
    "you are the only with with access, and you have `+rwx` permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, identify the UH `username` of the user with whom you would like to share\n",
    "your app. Given the username `my_collaborator`, grant that user permissions with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% apps-pems-update -u my_collaborator -p ALL username-tensorflow-0.1\n",
    "Successfully updated permission for my_collaborator\n",
    "\n",
    "# list permissions again\n",
    "% apps-pems-list username-tensorflow-0.1\n",
    "username READ WRITE EXECUTE\n",
    "my_collaborator READ WRITE EXECUTE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask your collaborator to perform the `apps-list` command, and they should now\n",
    "be able to see your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "##HANDS ON\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead an share and app with the person next to you - each of you perform the above operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update permissions on an execution system\n",
    "\n",
    "Before your collaborator can run a job with your app, they must also have correct permissions on the app execution system. Since you built your app to use a private execution system you must also grant your collaborator the correct permissions on that system.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tip: The app execution system is listed in the `app.json` file, or can be foundby issuing: '`apps-list -v --filter executionSystem app-name`'.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `systems-roles-list` command to see who can access it:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% systems-roles-list username-workshop-storage\n",
    "username OWNER\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Grant your collaborator `USER` access with the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% systems-roles-addupdate -u my_collaborator -r USER username-workshop-storage\n",
    "Successfully updated roles for user my_collaborator on username-workshop-storage\n",
    "\n",
    "# list permissions again\n",
    "% systems-roles-list username-workshop-storage\n",
    "USERNAME OWNER\n",
    "my_collaborator USER\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask your collaborator to perform the `systems-list` command, and they should now\n",
    "be able to see your private system. Now, your collaborator can run jobs against\n",
    "your private app using the same `job.json` file and `jobs-submit` commands as you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sharing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tapis CLI makes it possible to share data with other users on the UH\n",
    "tenant, and import data from the web. Use your best judgement in deciding\n",
    "whether to copy shared data or link against shared data with the understanding\n",
    "that storage space is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Share files with another user\n",
    "\n",
    "File permissions are managed similar to Linux file permissions. To list the\n",
    "permissions on an existing file on the STORAGE system, issue:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% files-pems-list -S username-workshop-storage workshop/my_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should look similar to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "username READ WRITE EXECUTE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add permissions for another user (in this case with username '`collaborator`')\n",
    "to view the file, use the `files-pems-update` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% files-pems-update -U collaborator -P ALL -S username-workshop-storage workshop/my_file.txt\n",
    "% files-pems-list -S username-workshop-storage workshop/my_file.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "collaborator READ WRITE EXECUTE\n",
    "username READ WRITE EXECUTE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a user with username `collaborator` has permissions to access the file.\n",
    "Valid values for setting permission with the `-P` flag are READ, WRITE, EXECUTE,\n",
    "READ_WRITE, READ_EXECUTE, WRITE_EXECUTE, ALL, and NONE. This same action can be\n",
    "performed recursively on directories using the `-R` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the collaborator needs the correct permissions to access your STORAGE\n",
    "system. To see who has access to your STORAGE system, perform:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% systems-roles-list username-workshop-storage\n",
    "username OWNER\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add your collaborator to your system, use the `systems-roles-addupdate` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% systems-roles-addupdate -u collaborator -r GUEST username-workshop-storage\n",
    "Successfully updated roles for user collaborator on username-workshop-storage\n",
    "\n",
    "% systems-roles-list username-workshop-storage\n",
    "collaborator GUEST\n",
    "username OWNER\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a user with username `collaborator` can see files with the appropriate\n",
    "permissions on your STORAGE system. Valid values for setting a role with the `-r`\n",
    "flag are GUEST, USER, PUBLISHER, ADMIN, and OWNER.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, ask your collaborator to download the file with the exact same command\n",
    "you use to download the file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% files-get -S username-workshop-storage workshop/my_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Share files using postits\n",
    "\n",
    "Another convenient way to share data is the Tapis postits service. Postits\n",
    "generate a short URL with a user-specified lifetime and limited number of uses.\n",
    "Anyone with the URL can paste it into a web browser, or curl against it on the\n",
    "command line. To create a postit:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% postits-create -m 5 -l 3600 \\\n",
    "    https://uhhpctenant.its.hawaii.edu/files/v2/media/system/dusername-workshop-storage/workshop/my_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The json response from this command is a URL, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://uhhpctenant.its.hawaii.edu/postits/v2/866d55b36a459e8098173655e916fa15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This postit is only good for 5 downloads (`-m 5`) and only available for one hour (3600 seconds, `-l 3600`). The creator of the postit can list and delete their postits with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "% postits-list -V\n",
    "% postits-delete 866d55b36a459e8098173655e916fa15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The long alphanumeric string is the postit UUID displayed by the verbose postits-list command.\n",
    "\n"
