    "The Agave API provides a way to access and manage the data storage and compute resources you already use (or maybe the systems you want to use), but first you have to tell Agave where they are, how to login, and how to communicate with that system.  That is done by giving Agave a short JSON description for each system.  \n",

    "## Storage Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage systems tell Agave where data resides.  You can store files for running compute jobs, archive results, share files with collaborators, and maintain copies of your Agave apps on storage systems.  Agave supports many of the communication protocols and  permissions models that go along with them, so you can work privately, collaborate with individuals, or provide an open community resource.  It's up to you.  Here is an example of a simple data storage system accessed via SFTP:\n",

    "* **executionType** - Either HPC, Condor, or CLI.  Specifies how jobs should go into the system. HPC and Condor will leverage a batch scheduler. CLI will fork processes.\n",
    "* **scheduler** - For HPC or CONDOR systems, Agave is \"scheduler aware\" and can use most popular schedulers to launch jobs on the system.  This field can be LSF, LOADLEVELER, PBS, SGE, CONDOR, FORK, COBALT, TORQUE, MOAB, SLURM, UNKNOWN. The type of batch scheduler available on the system.\n",
    "* **environment** - List of key-value pairs that will be added to the Linux shell environment prior to execution of any command.\n",
    "* **scratchDir** - Whenever Agave runs a job, it uses a temporary directory to cache any app assets or job data it needs to run the job.  This job directory will exist under the \"scratchDir\" that you set.  The path in this field will be resolved relative to the rootDir value in the storage config if it begins with a \"/\", and relative to the system homeDir otherwise.\n",
